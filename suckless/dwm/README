Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).
    make clean install

Running dwm
    exec dwm 	.xinitrc

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:
    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
